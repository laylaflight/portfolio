        <h2 class="K">I am making this assesable to all users by being relatable to all. I thought that it was cool how other peoples backgrounds were moving or very animated.
        They did this by adding moving image background in css connecting an url.Im most proud of learning about 
            using animated backgrounds.</h2>

        <h1>Obamicon Project </h1>
        <h3> Before Edits </h3>

        document.GetElementById("h1").onchange = function()
        <h2>From this project we learned what lists were and how they work. A list is a data type that produces number of order values. List are useful for when you want certain values to together. While I was completing this project I had help from Sanjida to help me 
        understand how to alter the image. I think when we work independently we learn more espically when we try it on our own for a while and then get help from our peers.</h2>
        <h1>Robotics</h1>
        <img src = "20170718_094641.jpg"
        <h3>This is JGanrera the Robot. With my team we were able to make it move and make noise. We choregraphed it to the song "Eye
        of the Tiger", so whenever the beat came on it would move to the beat and it turned dramatically. Overall, this experience was fun
        and once it was perfected was a great success as you may see below</h3>

        <h1>Gibson Dunn</h1>
        <h3>Visiting Gibson Dunn was a great experience because hearing these stories about cyber security and heart felt stories about 
        helping people in need with the use of law was very informal and interesting to me.</h3>
        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <h3>While experimenting with JavaScript it was fairly easy to get the concept since I had experience with JQuery , a similar language.
        One way I used to JavaScript to make my page interactive was when you go to the obamaicon image, it is able to switch back and forth
        from the before image to the after edited image. This happens evrytime you hover over the image. </h3>
        <h1>Django</h1>
        <h3>When working with Django , you had to follow a set of directions in order to create a blog. For majority of the day we were
            working on the back end part of web programming. In other words , we got to experience the job of a front end and back end 
            web developer. Working the back end way was a little difficult , mainly because of syntax errors such as if you make a mistake 
            or miss one step the whole thing is ruined. Other times the computer is just not understanding , bunbarding you with errors.
            However, using Django is very useful and can bring a great outcome when you get the finally get the concept. </h3>
