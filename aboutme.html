        They did this by adding moving image background in css connecting an url.Im most proud of learning about 
            using animated backgrounds.</h2>

        <h2>From this project we learned what lists were and how they work. A list is a data type that produces number of order values. List are useful for when you want certain values to together. While I was completing this project I had help from Sanjida to help me 
        understand how to alter the image. I think when we work independently we learn more espically when we try it on our own for a while and then get help from our peers.</h2>

        <h3>This is JGanrera the Robot. With my team we were able to make it move and make noise. We choregraphed it to the song "Eye
        of the Tiger", so whenever the beat came on it would move to the beat and it turned dramatically. Overall, this experience was fun
        and once it was perfected was a great success as you may see below</h3>
